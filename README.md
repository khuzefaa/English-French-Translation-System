# English-French-Translation-System
A comprehensive machine learning project implementing bidirectional English-French translation using state-of-the-art neural machine translation models. This project demonstrates various translation approaches, quality evaluation metrics, and practical applications for language processing tasks.
This project implements a complete translation pipeline using two different neural machine translation approaches:

Marian MT Models: Specialized translation models trained specifically for English-French language pairs
T5 Models: Multi-task transformer models adapted for translation tasks through task-specific prompting

The system provides bidirectional translation capabilities (English â†” French) with comprehensive quality evaluation and performance analysis.
